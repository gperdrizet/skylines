# Skylines CAA artifacts

This project was originally conceived in 2020? as a method to gain intuition about convolution, GANs and generated imagery via experimentation. The neural network created was designed to by trainable on easily accessible hardware, with small datasets and to illustrate what sort of 'imagination' a machine is capable of. The original generation targets included: flowers, city skylines, nebulae, hands, fruit and birds.

The project was 'completed' and shared via Instagram and Twitter between 2020? and 2020? under the name random_praxis_memory (user: @floraxx on both platforms).

In 2024, the project was revived in collaboration with Assistant Professor of Fine Art, Laura Perdrizet (University of Mount St. Vincent). Professor Perdrizet used the GAN's output to incite critical dialogue about AI and to incorporate machine learning as a creative tool and as a source of art material in her studio art courses.

The resulting artworks and analysis are impressive and aspirational, well illustrating the potential for advanced machine learning techniques in human creative endeavors. The collaboration is ongoing and preliminary results were presented by Professor Perdrizet at the 2024 College Art Association conference in Chicago, IL.

This branch of the skylines repository serves as an archive of artifacts created for and relevant to the collaboration.
